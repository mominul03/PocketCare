Health Chat Feature - Enhancement Plan
=====================================

1. Conversation History
   - Show previous chat messages with timestamps.
   - Allow users to scroll through past questions and answers.

2. User Feedback
   - Add thumbs up/down or “Was this helpful?” button for each AI response.
   - Use feedback to improve future answers or flag poor responses.

3. Quick Actions & Suggestions
   - Provide suggested questions as clickable buttons.
   - Offer quick links to common health topics.

4. File/Image Upload
   - Allow users to upload images (e.g., photos of prescriptions, symptoms) for AI analysis (if supported).

5. Save/Export Chat
   - Let users download or email their chat history for reference.

6. Professional Escalation
   - If the AI detects a serious health issue, suggest contacting a doctor or provide a “Book Appointment” button.

7. Personalization
   - Greet users by name.
   - Tailor advice based on age, gender, or known health conditions (if user profile data is available).

8. Disclaimers & Safety
   - Clearly display a disclaimer that the AI is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
   - Remind users to consult a healthcare provider for urgent or serious issues.

9. Accessibility
   - Support text-to-speech for responses.
   - Make the chat interface keyboard and screen-reader friendly.

10. Loading & Error States
    - Show a loading spinner while the AI is “thinking.”
    - Display clear error messages if the AI service is unavailable.

11. Multi-language Support
    - Allow users to chat in their preferred language.

12. Styling & UX
    - Use avatars for user and AI messages.
    - Add color coding or icons for different types of advice (diet, exercise, symptoms, etc.).

Summary:
Start with conversation history, feedback, quick suggestions, and clear disclaimers. Add more advanced features (file upload, personalization, escalation) as needed for your academic or demo goals.
